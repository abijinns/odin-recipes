# odin-recipes
My first project on WebDev by The Odin Project 

The goal of this project is to practice basic HTML by creating a simple recipes website.  
It includes a main index page and a few recipe pages linked together using relative paths.

## What I practiced

- HTML boilerplate
- Headings and paragraphs
- Ordered and unordered lists
- Links between pages
- Adding images
- Basic project folder structure

This project focuses only on HTML. Styling will be added later in the course
